/**
 * An interface for implementations of event lists. Different implementations
 * are provided in SSJ: doubly-linked list, splay tree, Henricksenâ€™s method,
 * etc. The *events* in the event list are objects of the class
 * @ref umontreal.ssj.simevents.Event. The method
 * umontreal.ssj.simevents.Sim.init(EventList) permits one to select the
 * actual implementation used in a simulation @cite sKIN85a&thinsp;.
 *
 * To allow the user to print the event list, the  java.lang.Object.toString
 * method from the  Object class should be reimplemented in all
 * <tt>EventList</tt> implementations. It will return a string in the
 * following format: "<tt>Contents of the event list </tt><em>event list
 * class</em><tt>:</tt>" for the first line and each subsequent line has
 * format "<em>scheduled event time</em><tt>, </tt><em>event
 * priority</em>&nbsp;<tt>:</tt>&nbsp;<em>event string</em>". The *event
 * string* is obtained by calling the <tt>toString</tt> method of the event
 * objects. The string should not end with the end-of-line character.
 *
 * The following example is the event list of the bank example, printed at
 * 10h30. See <tt>examples.pdf</tt> for more information.
