/**
 * Represents the portion of the simulatorâ€™s state associated with
 * continuous-time simulation. Any simulator, including the default static
 * one, can have an associate continuous state which is obtained using the
 * `continuousState()` method of the  @ref Simulator class. This state
 * includes all active integration variables as well as the current
 * integration method.
 *
 * One of the methods  #selectEuler,  #selectRungeKutta2 or
 * #selectRungeKutta4 must be called before starting any integration. These
 * methods permit one to select the numerical integration method and the step
 * size `h` (in time units) that will be used for *all* continuous-time
 * variables linked to the simulator. For all the methods, an integration
 * step at time @f$t@f$ changes the values of the variables from their old
 * values at time @f$t-h@f$ to their new values at time @f$t@f$.
 *
 * Each integration step is scheduled as an event and added to the event
 * list.
