/**
 * A special kind of Markov chain whose state space is a subset of the real
 * numbers. The state is stored in the double variable `state`.
 *
 * The "Double" version of the methods from Markov Chain now returns the
 * state. This makes it possible to simulate several copies of this chain in
 * parallel without cloning and without maintaining the state of the chain in
 * a local variable. The states can be maintained in an external array and at
 * each step, one passes the current state to the method
 * <tt>nextStepDouble</tt>, which returns the next state. This is exploited
 * in the implementation of <tt>ArrayOfDoubleChains</tt>.
 *
 * The methods  #initialState,  #nextStep, <tt>getPerformance</tt> and
 * #compareTo, which are abstract in  @ref MarkovChainComparable, all have a
 * default implementation here, so the methods of Markov Chain still work.
 *
 * On the other hand, the abstract methods specified in the present class do
 * not necessarily update local variables.
 *
 * Abstract method `compareTo` from class `MarkovChainComparable` is
 * implemented by comparing variable `state` of the chains. And method
 * `dimension` now returns 1, thereâ€™s no need to set variable `stateDim`.
