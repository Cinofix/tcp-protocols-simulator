/**
 * This interface is used to randomize a  @ref umontreal.ssj.hups.PointSet.
 * One can implement method  #randomize(PointSet) in any way. This method
 * must use an internal  @ref umontreal.ssj.rng.RandomStream. This stream can
 * be set in the constructor, but the methods  #getStream and
 * #setStream(RandomStream) must be implemented.
 *
 * The method  #randomize(PointSet) must be implemented using combinations of
 * the randomization methods from the point set such as
 * umontreal.ssj.hups.PointSet.addRandomShift,
 * umontreal.ssj.hups.DigitalNet.leftMatrixScramble,
 * umontreal.ssj.hups.DigitalNet.stripedMatrixScramble, â€¦
 *
 * If more than one  @ref PointSetRandomization is applied to the same point
 * set, the randomizations will concatenate if they are of different types,
 * but only the last of each type will remain.
 *
 * @remark **Pierre:** There should be examples to illustrate how this works
 * and how to use it.
