/**
 * @remark **Pierre:** The `CachedPointSet` class also offers methods for
 * multi-dimensional sort and for skipping coordinates.
 *
 *  This class is useful for the Array-RQMC method, in the situation where
 * the Markov chain has a multidimensional state, the RQMC points are sorted
 * once for all, based on their first @f$\ell@f$ coordinates, then these
 * coordinates are removed and only the remaining coordinates are kept and
 * randomized at each step.
 *
 * It builds a sorted point set based on a given original point set. The
 * original points are first sorted based on their first @f$\ell@f$
 * coordinates, via a  @ref umontreal.ssj.util.MultiDimSort in @f$\ell@f$
 * dimensions, and this is used to build an index that stores the
 * corresponding permutation, once for all. Then those @f$\ell@f$
 * coordinates are removed from the points and never seen again. After that,
 * when the points are enumerated, only the remaining coordinates are used
 * and the points are enumerated by following the index. When they are
 * randomized, the randomization is applied to the original point set, but
 * only the remaining coordinates are randomized. If the original point set
 * has dimension @f$d_0@f$, the retained point set will have dimension
 * @f$d_0 - \ell@f$.
 *
 * In this implementation, the retained coordinates of the points are cached,
 * and they are re-cached after reach randomization.
 * @remark **Pierre:** This could be inefficient (and unnecessary) for very
 * large point sets. One could implement an iterator that uses directly the
 * randomized points in `P` without caching them.
 *
 *  To perform the sort, we first cache only the sorting coordinates of the
 * points, with an extra coordinate that holds the original number of each
 * point, and we apply the sort to those cached points. This extra coordinate
 * is used to recover the permutation made by the sort and to produce the
 * index.
