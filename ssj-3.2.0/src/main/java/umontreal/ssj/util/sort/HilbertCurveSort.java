/**
 * This class implements a  @ref MultiDimSort01<T extends MultiDim01> that can sort an array of
 * points in the @f$d@f$-dimensional unit hypercube @f$[0,1)^d@f$, by
 * following a Hilbert curve, and using (at most) the first @f$m@f$ bits of
 * each point. See @cite iHAM07a&thinsp;. The objects sorted by this class
 * can only be points in @f$[0,1)^d@f$, represented as arrays of `double`.
 * This sort does not apply directly to more general  @ref MultiDimComparable<T>
 * objects. For that, see the class \ref HilbertCurveBatchSort instead. 
 * However, this sort can be applied to
 * points in another space if we first define a mapping between this space
 * and the unit hypercube. For example, to sort points in the real space, it
 * suffices to map each coordinate to @f$[0,1)@f$.
 *
 * This sort (conceptually) divides the unit hypercube @f$[0,1)^d@f$ in
 * @f$2^{dm}@f$ subcubes of equal sizes, by dividing each axis in @f$2^m@f$
 * equal parts, and uses the first @f$m@f$ bits of each of the @f$d@f$
 * coordinates to place each point in one of the subcubes. It then enumerates
 * the subcubes in the same order as a Hilbert curve in @f$[0,1)^d@f$ would
 * visit them, and orders the points accordingly. Each cube has an (integer)
 * Hilbert index @f$r@f$ from 0 to @f$2^{dm}-1@f$ and the cubes (and points)
 * are ordered according to this index. Two points that fall in the same
 * subcube can be placed in an unspecified (arbitrary) order.
 *
 * It may happen that some of the subcubes contain more than one point at the
 * end. To get a sense of the probability that this happens, in the case
 * where there are @f$n@f$ points and these points are independent and
 * uniformly distributed over @f$[0,1)^d@f$, it is known that the number
 * @f$C@f$ of collisions (the number of times that a point falls in a box
 * already occupied by another point when the points are generated one after
 * the other) has approximately a Poisson distribution with mean
 * @f$\lambda_c = n^2/(2k)@f$, where @f$k = 2^{md}@f$. See
 * @cite rLEC02c&thinsp;, for example. By taking @f$m@f$ such that @f$2^{md}
 * \geq n^2@f$, the expected number of collisions is less than 1/2 and then
 * one can often neglect them. Otherwise, one should increase @f$m@f$. Note
 * however that the assumption of uniformity and independence does not always
 * hold in practice.
 *
 * For the implementation of sorts based on the Hilbert curve (or Hilbert
 * index), we identify and sort the subcubes by their Hilbert index, but it
 * is also convenient to identify them (alternatively) with @f$m@f$-bit
 * integer coordinates: The subcube with coordinates @f$(i_1,…,i_d)@f$ is
 * defined as @f$\prod_{j=0}^{d-1} [i_j 2^{-m},  (i_j+1) 2^{-m})@f$. Note
 * that each interval is open on the right. That is, if we multiply the
 * coordinates of a point in the subcube by @f$2^m@f$ and truncate them to
 * integers, we obtain the integer coordinates of the subcube. For example,
 * if @f$d=2@f$ and @f$m=4@f$, we have @f$2^8 = 256@f$ subcubes, whose
 * integer coordinates go from 0 to 15, and the point @f$(0.1, 0.51)@f$
 * belongs to the subcube with integer coordinates @f$(1, 8)@f$.
 *
 * For given @f$d@f$ and @f$m@f$, this class offers methods to compute the
 * integer coordinates of the corresponding subcube from the real-valued
 * coordinates of a point in @f$[0,1)^d@f$, as well as the Hilbert index of a
 * subcube from its integer coordinates, and vice versa. The code that
 * computes the latter correspondences is taken (with slight adaptations)
 * from the `hilbert.c` program of Spencer W. Thomas, University of Michigan,
 * 1991.
 *
 * To sort a set of @f$n@f$ points in @f$[0,1)^d@f$, we first compute the
 * integer coordinates and then the Hilbert index of the subcube for each
 * point, then sort the points by order of Hilbert index. For the latter, we
 * construct an index of type `long[n][2]` whose first coordinate is the
 * point number and the second is its Hilbert index. The method
 * #sortIndexOfLong2 is provided to sort such an index by its second
 * coordinate. Points having the same Hilbert index are ordered arbitrarily.
 * After this sort, the first coordinate at position @f$i@f$ in the index is
 * the (original) number of the point that comes in position @f$i@f$ when the
 * points are sorted by Hilbert index. This index is used to reorder the
 * original points. It can be accessed (after each sort) via the method
 * #getIndexAfterSort(). This access can be convenient for example in case we
 * sort a `double[][]` array with the Hilbert sort and want to apply the
 * corresponding permutation afterward to another array of objects. Certain
 * subclasses of HilbertCurveSort use this.
