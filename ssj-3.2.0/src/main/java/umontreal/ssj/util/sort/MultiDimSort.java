/**
 * This interface is meant to be implemented by certain multivariate sorting
 * algorithms that sort objects based on different fields (or dimensions).
 * For example, in a list of animals, the animals can be sorted by both their
 * age, their weight, and their market value, in three dimensions. For
 * instance, one may want to regroup them based on their age, then split each
 * group based on the weight, and finally sort the subgroups based on market
 * value.
 *
 * The objects to be sorted have @f$d@f$ sorting fields (or coordinates),
 * which means that they can be seen as @f$d@f$-dimensional and can be sorted
 * according to any of the @f$d@f$ coordinates, which are numbered from 0 to
 * @f$d-1@f$. These objects can be simply @f$d@f$-dimensional vectors of
 * <tt>double</tt>â€™s, which are sorted in the natural way according to any of
 * the @f$d@f$ coordinates. They can also be more general types of objects
 * that implement the  @ref MultiDimComparable<T> interface, which is used to
 * sort them on any given coordinate. The ordering is then the one induced by
 * the method  \ref MultiDimComparable<T>#compareTo, and the
 * number of the largest coordinate used by the sort must not exceed
 * @f$d-1@f$, where the dimension @f$d@f$ refers to the value returned by
 * umontreal.ssj.util.MultiDimComparable.dimension. One can sort only a
 * subset of the objects, or all of them.
 *
 * Certain types of sorts can use several coordinates at the same time to
 * sort the objects; see the classes  @ref BatchSort and
 * @ref HilbertCurveSort, for example. These types of sorts have an
 * application in particular in the array-RQMC method to simulate Markov
 * chains @cite vLEC08a&thinsp;.
