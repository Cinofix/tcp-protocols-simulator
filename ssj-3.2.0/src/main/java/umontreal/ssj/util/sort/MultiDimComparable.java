/**
 * This interface is an extension (or variant) of the  Comparable interface
 * in Java. In the  Comparable interface, the objects can be compared in only
 * one way, so there is a single total ordering between the objects. Here,
 * there is a choice of @f$d@f$ different ways (or criteria, or coordinates)
 * to compare the objects. These coordinates are indexed by @f$j =
 * 0,…,d-1@f$. The coordinate @f$j@f$ that is to used by the comparison must
 * be specified as the second argument in the method  {@link #compareTo()
 * compareTo(other, j)}. This interface must be implemented in particular by
 * objects that are to be sorted via a  @ref MultiDimSortComparable.
 *
 * The objects that are compared may really have a multidimensional behavior,
 * or they may not. For example, an object that contains an array can
 * implement this interface by defining  {@link #compareTo() compareTo(other,
 * j)} so that it compares the elements of index `j` in the arrays from the
 * two objects. As another example, if an object represents a person and
 * contains some information on that person, the method  #compareTo may
 * compare two persons based on the age, or height, er weight, etc., and
 * @f$j@f$ specifies which one. It can also be used to compare in different
 * ways, like comparing the birth date including the birth year to know who
 * is younger or comparing the birth date without the year to know who has
 * his next birthday first.
 *
 * For details on how to use these comparisons in algorithms that require an
 * ordinary Java  Comparator, such as the `sort` methods in class `Arrays`,
 * see  @ref MultiDimComparator.
