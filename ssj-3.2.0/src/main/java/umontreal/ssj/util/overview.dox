 * General basic utilities.
 *
 * This document describes a set of basic utilities  used in the Java
 * software developed in the *simulation laboratory* of the DIRO, at the
 * Université de Montréal. Many of these tools were originally implemented in
 * the Modula-2 language and have been translated in C and then in Java, with
 * some adaptations along the road.
