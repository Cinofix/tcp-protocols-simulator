/**
 * Extends the  @ref AbstractChrono class to compute the global CPU time used
 * by the Java Virtual Machine. This includes CPU time taken by any thread,
 * including the garbage collector, class loader, etc.
 *
 * Part of this class is implemented in the C language and the implementation
 * is unfortunately operating system-dependent. The C functions for the
 * current class have been compiled on a 32-bit machine running Linux. For a
 * *platform-independent* CPU timer (valid only with Javaâ€“1.5 or later), one
 * should use the class  @ref ThreadCPUTimeChrono which is programmed
 * directly in Java.
