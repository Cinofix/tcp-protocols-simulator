/**
 * Represents a function of multiple variables. This interface specifies a
 * method `evaluate` that computes a @f$g(\mathbf{x})@f$ function, where
 * @f$\mathbf{x}=(x_0,â€¦,x_{d-1})\in\mathbb{R}^d@f$. It also specifies a
 * method `evaluateGradient` for computing its gradient
 * @f$\nabla g(\mathbf{x})@f$.
 *
 * The dimension @f$d@f$ can be fixed or variable. When @f$d@f$ is fixed, the
 * methods specified by this interface always take the same number of
 * arguments. This is the case, for example, with a ratio of two variables.
 * When @f$d@f$ is variable, the implementation can compute the function for
 * a vector @f$\mathbf{x}@f$ of any length. This can happen for a product or
 * sum of variables.
 *
 * The methods of this interface take a variable number of arguments to
 * accomodate the common case of fixed dimension with more convenience; the
 * programmer can call the method without creating an array. For the generic
 * case, however, one can replace the arguments with an array.
